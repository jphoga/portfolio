## University

I did not study computer science or anything IT related at all. My major was Japanese Studies (which I loved) and my minor Media Studies (for which I had strongly mixed feelings). During my studies I got in touch with the wonderful world of programming by taking some Java-classes and basic programming tutorials. These were so much fun that I decided to definitely deep-dive into computer science later on, but since I was already pretty advanced with my regular studies I had to finish these first.

## First Working Years

So after finishing my studies and finding a first job, the game was on again - Programming here I come! But this proved to be pretty hard and in case you ever have lived and worked in Japan you know what I mean: no time at all after many many overtime hours in the evening, and Sat/Sun are of course fun-days. I also was not quite sure what to build with my basic Java skills that could be fun. So I was a bit at loss for some time...

Luckily I chose a profession at least close to the stuff I wanted to learn. So while working as a IT-Consultant implementing ERP systems all over the planet, I could sometimes touch program code in the form of design documents and testing/debugging.  

## Le Wagon bootcamp

But working at the design and testing site of financial programs with a strange language (anyone knows ABAP?) wasn't enough. I decided to take unpaid leave for two month and enrolled into Le Wagon web-developer bootcamp in Meguro, Tokyo. I had so much fun I couldn't believe myself. After a wonderful time with awesome people and great teachers I finally decided on what to do: a career in the tech-world!

## Same job, different role

With my newly build Full-Stack skill set, I went back to my current company and asked for a position in a developer team. They put in the IoT team to build applications and infrastructure for different projects and clients - a job where I can use my programming skills, learn a ton of different languages and frameworks (e.g. Java Spring-Boot, Python Flask, Node Express) as well as working with Cloud providers (especially AWS). I could even build a deep learning model for object recognition (Tensorflow) and put my fingers on robot applications (ROS).
