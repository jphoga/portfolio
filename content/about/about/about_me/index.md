## University - first encounters with coding

I did not study computer science or anything IT related. My major was Japanese Studies (which I loved) and my minor was Media Studies (for which I had strongly mixed feelings... let's say it's the perfect fit for anyone who gets excited by analyzing rare and dusty black & white movies from 1920's). 

During my studies I got in touch with the wonderful world of programming by taking some Java classes and basic coding tutorials. These were so much fun that I decided to fully deep dive into computer science sometime soon. But since I was pretty advanced in my regular studies already I had to finish those first (definitely check out [Fritz Lang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Lang) and [Ozu Yasujiro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasujir%C5%8D_Ozu) movies - they are great!).

And part of my studies about Japan was of course visiting my beloved Tokyo in person every now and again

## Early working years - building a foundation  

The programming game was on again when I got my first job - coding here I come! But I soon realized that learning how to code next to the daily working routine proved to be much harder than expected. And in case you have ever lived and worked in Japan you know what I mean: no time AT ALL in the evening after many, many, many hours of overtime while Saturdays & Sundays on the other hand are dearly needed for sleep. Well, and for fun of course - it can't get better than a party weekend in Tokyo!

I was also not quite sure how to build something fun & useful with my basic Java skills from university classes, and so I was a bit at a loss for some time...

Luckily I chose a profession which was close to the things I wanted to learn. So while working as an IT-consultant implementing ERP systems all over the planet, I was handling lots of program code while creating design documents and testing & debugging financial programs. Apart from that, being a consultant has its benefits and needs its own set of skills to be polished, which come in handy when there are problems to be analyzed, clients to be convinced or just by being quick & efficient with Excel and Powerpoint.

## Le Wagon bootcamp - deep dive into coding

But designing and testing financial programs in a strange language (anyone knows ABAP...?) didn't fully satisfy me. So I decided to take unpaid leave for two months and enrolled into the [Le Wagon](http://lewagon.com) web-developer bootcamp in Meguro, Tokyo. 

Best decision EVER! 

Honestly. I had so much fun I couldn't believe myself. After a wonderful time with awesome people and great teachers I finally decided on what to do: a career in the tech-world!

We all got a good grasp of the following skills in those 9 weeks:

1. **Ruby on Rails** as back-end language 
2. **HTML, CSS & JavaScript** for front-end
3. **GitHub, git & Linux** for version management 
4. **Postgresql and SQL** for database control 
5. Various product management & design tools 


I miss my team members. Cheers to you! <i class="em em-beers" aria-role="presentation" aria-label="CLINKING BEER MUGS"></i>

## Same job, different role - coding, coding, coding!

Equipped with my new full-stack coding skills I went back to my company and convinced them to give me position as a developer. They were happy to put me into the Internet of Things (IoT) sector where we create and sell solutions and services to bring Digital Transformation to our clients. Here now I am - a member of the development team building awesome applications and cloud infrastructure for global projects and international clients. 

I am designing applications and writing code from morning to evening, learn a ton of different languages and frameworks (lately e.g. **Java Spring Boot, Python Flask, Node Express**) as well as working with **AWS Cloud services** on a pretty deep level. 

I even got the chance to build a **Deep Learning model** for object detection using transfer learning with **Tensorflow**. And this all while rewriting an application build in [ROS](http://ros.org) (**Robot Operating System**) running on an **Nvidia Edge Server**. Check out my [Projects Page](/projects) to read more about some of the cool things I did so far. I tried to write the project stories like a tech-blog entry so that people can learn a few things too.   

Happy coding! <i class="em em-male-technologist" aria-role="presentation" aria-label=""></i>
