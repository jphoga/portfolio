description: Some facts about me.

## University

I did not study computer science or anything IT related at all. My major was Japanese Studies (which I loved) and my minor Media Studies (for which I had strongly mixed feelings). During my studies I got in touch with the wonderful world of programming by taking some Java-classes and basic programming tutorials. These were so much fun that I decided to definitely deep-dive into computer science later on, but since I was already pretty advanced with my regular studies I had to finish these first.

## First Working Years

So when I got my first job, the game was on again - programming here I come! But learning how to program next to the daily working routine proved to be much harder than I expected, and in case you have ever lived and worked in Japan you know what I mean: no time at all in the evening after the many, many hours of overtime, and Sat/Sun are of course fun-days (it can't get better than a Tokyo weekend!). I also was not quite sure how to build something fun with my basic Java skills, and so I was a bit at loss for some time...

Luckily I chose a profession which was somehhow close to the stuff I wanted to learn. So while working as a IT-Consultant implementing ERP systems all over the planet, I could sometimes touch program code in the form of design documents and testing/debugging.  

## Le Wagon bootcamp

But designing and testing financial programs in a strange language (anyone knows ABAP...?) didn't really satisfy me. I decided to take unpaid leave for two month and enrolled into the Le Wagon web-developer bootcamp in Meguro, Tokyo. Honestly, I had so much fun I couldn't believe myself. After a wonderful time with awesome people and great teachers I finally decided on what to do: a career in the tech-world!

## Same job, different role

With my new full-stack skill set I went back to my company and asked for a position in a developer team. They put in the IoT team to build applications and infrastructure for different projects and clients. This now is a job where I can use my programming skills, learn a ton of different languages and frameworks (e.g. Java Spring-Boot, Python Flask, Node Express) as well as working with Cloud providers on a pretty deep level (especially AWS). I could even build a Deep Learning model for object recognition using Tensorflow SSD and put my fingers on robot applications (ROS) to run it on 'edge'. Go to my [projects page](/projects) to find out more about some of my projects I have done so far. 

Cheers!
