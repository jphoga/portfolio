Our final project at the Le Wagon bootcamp in Tokyo (July/August 2018) was tough and fun at the same time for a lot of reasons: tough because we barely had two weeks to go from the initial idea to a full-fledged web-app which we had to pitch in front of about 100 people coming to Impact Hub for our final batch presentations. We, four coding students from different professions and countries (Peru, China, US and Germany),   

My three team mates and me created a **one-stop shop shop for monitoring prices, news mixed with social media for Crypto Currencies**. Our time was limited but all teams delivered amazing prototypes during our last week at the bootcamp.

The idea behind the "coin-spread" crypto dashboard had our buddy and business team lead David. He works in Finance and while dealing with crypto currency he was lamenting that although a lot of crypto dashboards do exist, not one of them could make you communicate with like-minded peeps as in social network to exchange messages about latest events. We also added a portfolio page where one can log-in and track their current crypto-wealth (...or damage).
