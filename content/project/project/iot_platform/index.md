I had never really understood the term **Internet of Things**. Like its sibling **Artificial Intelligence** you can read it everywhere like an omen for new technology and a new age, but what does it actually mean when you work in this field? 

When I went back to my company after taking a two month break from work to learn building web apps at Le Wagon bootcamp, I discussed with my boss what I could do to help the company with my coding skills. He put me in the rather new Internet of Things sector - and here I am (still), consulting clients about how to adopt **Industry 4.0** (another big word) and building solutions to support their digital needs. 

Since then I learned quite a bit about IoT. Especially that it is not only about the coffee machine communicating with the toaster as to when coffee and toast should be ready (although coffee and toast are really nice together). Our sector is working with clients to bring ideas of Industry 4.0 to their companies and mainly their factories.
