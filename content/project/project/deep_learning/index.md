Deep Learning is great and a lot of fun! 

This is at least what I found out after being assigned to an already running project using four different Deep Learning models inside the same program and I had to figure out what each one was doing and how they connect. 



Did you know that "despite its name, salted duck eggs can also be made from
chicken eggs, though the taste and texture will be somewhat different, and the
egg yolk will be less rich."?
([Wikipedia Link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg))

Yeah, I didn't either.
