 The idea behind the "coin-spread" crypto dashboard had our buddy and biz-team lead David. He works in Finance also dealing with crypto currency and he was lamenting that although a lot of crypto dashboards do exist, not one of them could make you communicate with like-minded peeps as in social network to exchange messages about latest events. We also added a portfolio page where one can log-in and track their current crypto-wealth (...or damage).[m

 Another cool part of the project was that I got in touch with an awesome framework called ROS (Robotic Operating System). We didn't use any robotic arms or self-drving capacities in our project but nevertheless ROS is sometimes a great option in case you want your application to run autonomously. This meant in our case switch it on and let it run without any user control (there wasn't even a UI to control the app while it ran). [m
